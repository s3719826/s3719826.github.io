  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>A little about me: I was born in Israel and have Russian parents, I have been living in Australia for the last 12 years I speak Hebrew,
    Russian and English although English is my most fluent language, I have studied Computer Science at RMIT for 4 years now with this being my last semester.
    My favourite hobby other than playing games (who doesn’t) is building 3D puzzles!</p>
  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>I started getting interested in IT due to my constant use of computers, I have always loved games (especially at a young age) and have always been curious into how they are made, but as I have no artistic talent (even my stick figures look ugly) 
    I have settled for the next closest thing which is programming applications and websites. 
    I haven’t really had any event or person spark my interest in the IT field but once thing that has definitely swayed and assisted in my love for the field is the fact that out of my 2 pairs of parents(step parents + birth) 
    all of them are in the I.T degree whether it be the software or the hardware side of it.
    For year 10 for my experience program I went to Coles to learn in their I.T Students Experience Program and 
    I am currently working a full time job as a support at an ERP system company and will be looking into getting into the development team.
    I chose to come to RMIT as it is the best university in Australia to provide I.T / Technological learning.
    As this is the end of my degree I have learnt quite a bit, I have learnt many languages from OO programming such as Java, 
    Python and C++ to html and web programming. I have also learned the ethics behind programming and have learnt how to work in groups whilst in the I.T degree.
