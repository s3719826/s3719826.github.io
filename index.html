  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>A little about me: I was born in Israel and have Russian parents, I have been living in Australia for the last 12 years I speak Hebrew,
    Russian and English although English is my most fluent language, I have studied Computer Science at RMIT for 4 years now with this being my last semester.
    My favourite hobby other than playing games (who doesn’t) is building 3D puzzles!</p>
  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>I started getting interested in IT due to my constant use of computers, I have always loved games (especially at a young age) and have always been curious into how they are made, but as I have no artistic talent (even my stick figures look ugly) 
    I have settled for the next closest thing which is programming applications and websites. 
    I haven’t really had any event or person spark my interest in the IT field but once thing that has definitely swayed and assisted in my love for the field is the fact that out of my 2 pairs of parents(step parents + birth) 
    all of them are in the I.T degree whether it be the software or the hardware side of it.
    For year 10 for my experience program I went to Coles to learn in their I.T Students Experience Program and 
    I am currently working a full time job as a support at an ERP system company and will be looking into getting into the development team.
    I chose to come to RMIT as it is the best university in Australia to provide I.T / Technological learning.
    As this is the end of my degree I have learnt quite a bit, I have learnt many languages from OO programming such as Java, 
    Python and C++ to html and web programming. I have also learned the ethics behind programming and have learnt how to work in groups whilst in the I.T degree.

  <h2><a href = "https://www.seek.com.au/job/56400876?type=standout#sol=5426fdfe7863310c730b7f4fe6dd41298cd5dbf0">Seek Webpage for Job.</a></h2>
  <p>Although this job is in Gold Coast it would be something that I would be looking at as a representation of what I would like my future job to be, 
   the appeal to me is a big company that is quite famous and therefore will give me a lot of experience and the feel for the degree and allows for me to improve 
    my coding ability especially as it gives online tools for learning such as Udemy and Pluralsight,
    I also currently use Westpac as my bank so that is an added bonus.
    This job has skills that I have already learned throughout my degree as this is my final semester, it requires ReactJS and knowledge in JavaScript which 
    I had done throughout most of my degree and especially in Web Programming course, 
    it also will use NodeJS which is something I have used before in hand with ReactJS and have experience in.
    They also prefer experience in VS Code which is my preferred application for coding as well as requiring Agile tools such as JIRA and 
    although I Don’t have experience in JIRA itself I have experience in Trello and the Agile process.
    For its development process they use test driven development which is very appealing to me as I have used Jest before for my web related programming.
    Something I would need to improve on and acquire as skills are the use of CI/CD tools such as Jenkins or Bamboo as it is recommended for the job and 
    I would do so by creating a website that I can continuously update as I update the code, 
    this would be a project in my own time that I would use to build up my portfolio.

  <p>
  These tests let me know that I have the personality that works hard and strives to improve myself, It also tells me that I like to experiment with new things to improve myself and change the way I am.

  Although these personality tests may tell me who I am or how I interact with life, I think that everything depends on the scenario and my behaviour would depend on the team and their personalities.

  When forming a team personalities don’t matter too much, as long as they are cooperative as a team and work hard the rest of your personality shouldn’t matter, you can be whatever you want as long as you do your job.

  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <h2>Delivery Tracker</h2>
  <p>
    This project idea would be the creation of a 3rd party delivery tracker for any orders that you order online to be delivered to your place on websites such as Amazon and Kogan. This would allow for a webpage under a user’s account to view tracking from different companies and locations in a simpler way rather than having to connect to the different websites. This would require integration of multiple websites as the website would require the delivery information to be able to display it.

    The motivation behind this project is due to the increase in the need in ordering products from store to our doors due to the trying times that the corona virus has created, with the increase in use of websites such as Amazon and many companies doing deliveries there are now too many websites required to look at to view your deliveries at as depending on which website you order at will have its own delivery tracker, well the idea is to combine them all into one comfortable viewer that allows you to see the status of your orders no matter which company it is which allow the users of multiple companies convenience.
    This product would allow users to sign up with users to view their deliveries. On the main page you would have a list of your websites which you are ordering from that are clickable and direct you to a page where you can view just that companies’ deliveries, as well as having a total amount of current deliveries pending on the main page. Another addition to the main page would be a list of overdue deliveries that you may need to follow up from the company that is delayed, the company’s name and order ID would be displayed and therefore would allow for the user to search for the order at ease, our website will also supply a link that directly goes to the website. You would also be able to click on a dropdown which would allow you to view all deliveries from different companies ordered by companies or ordered by delivery date. There would also be the ability to look at your profile and edit it as required. One of the main features of this website is the button that redirects you to the listed delivery companies for the user. Delivery TrackerTM would have an API to receive information about the order and the website which is supplying the delivery would require to send updates to the API to update the delivery status and therefore the project would require to work together with companies to make it successful. There will be a basic API endpoint, but there would also be API endpoints specialised to different companies’ needs, making it less generic.
    At a certain point in the future we would like this to become a mobile app that sends updates as orders get updated to each customer it would also allow for users to view it on their phone in a phone friendly application.
    Something else that we would like to implement is the ability to control the orders from our website, operations such as cancelling, updating delivery location at the earlier stages but this would require the websites permission as well as an endpoint from their end.
    The last thing we would like to implement which would increase the reasons in which the user would like to use Delivery TrackerTM is to create a live map for all deliveries, which would show you either the location that they are at with the ability to click to view the information on the map, so without it moving to another page, or if its on the move to see the pathway at which it is going to, this can be a direct line as it wouldn’t be exact location, which would show the departure date as well as an estimated time to arrival.
    The Tracker would be free for users to use but would cost companies as per contract and size of company and will have support for any special occurrences of issues.
    The tools required for Delivery TrackerTM would be as simple as javascript, html,css for the languages as well as Node.js as a way to run it on a server, we would also require a testing framework such as JEST to ensure that the code is running correctly with no issues, it will also require a database such as SQL to keep all the user information as well as order information. It would also require very heavy protection so the information doesn’t leak as this will have private information such as delivery addresses which would cause major privacy issues for companies. Hardware required would be servers that would be most likely hosted on AWS which would be covered by ads displayed on the website, although initially as the clientele would be small something like Heroku or the base AWS will work.
    For writing this project I would require skills in Javascript, html, css, Node.js, JEST as well as SQL for the database most of these languages / tools have easy to use documentation that can be found on the internet and is feasible to find and learn. AWS which may be used as server might require a bit more research as there are many aspects to it and finding the right type of instance for the server will be difficult depending on the progress of the application, as there may be endpoints that would require different types of AWS services.

    If this project were to succeed it would allow the user to view any order of any company integrated with DeliveryTrackerTM and allow for live tracking as well as updating orders and allow for a more comfortable viewing with phone updates as status’ changes. This would make the use of many different websites and logins simpler. This implementation could become the biggest way to track deliveries and would be a great way for companies that do not have the ability to develop their own tracker have the ability to use a tracker.
