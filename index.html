  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>A little about me: I was born in Israel and have Russian parents, I have been living in Australia for the last 12 years I speak Hebrew,
    Russian and English although English is my most fluent language, I have studied Computer Science at RMIT for 4 years now with this being my last semester.
    My favourite hobby other than playing games (who doesn’t) is building 3D puzzles!</p>
  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>I started getting interested in IT due to my constant use of computers, I have always loved games (especially at a young age) and have always been curious into how they are made, but as I have no artistic talent (even my stick figures look ugly) 
    I have settled for the next closest thing which is programming applications and websites. 
    I haven’t really had any event or person spark my interest in the IT field but once thing that has definitely swayed and assisted in my love for the field is the fact that out of my 2 pairs of parents(step parents + birth) 
    all of them are in the I.T degree whether it be the software or the hardware side of it.
    For year 10 for my experience program I went to Coles to learn in their I.T Students Experience Program and 
    I am currently working a full time job as a support at an ERP system company and will be looking into getting into the development team.
    I chose to come to RMIT as it is the best university in Australia to provide I.T / Technological learning.
    As this is the end of my degree I have learnt quite a bit, I have learnt many languages from OO programming such as Java, 
    Python and C++ to html and web programming. I have also learned the ethics behind programming and have learnt how to work in groups whilst in the I.T degree.

  <h2><a href = "https://www.seek.com.au/job/56400876?type=standout#sol=5426fdfe7863310c730b7f4fe6dd41298cd5dbf0">Seek Webpage for Job.</a></h2>
  <p>Although this job is in Gold Coast it would be something that I would be looking at as a representation of what I would like my future job to be, 
   the appeal to me is a big company that is quite famous and therefore will give me a lot of experience and the feel for the degree and allows for me to improve 
    my coding ability especially as it gives online tools for learning such as Udemy and Pluralsight,
    I also currently use Westpac as my bank so that is an added bonus.
    This job has skills that I have already learned throughout my degree as this is my final semester, it requires ReactJS and knowledge in JavaScript which 
    I had done throughout most of my degree and especially in Web Programming course, 
    it also will use NodeJS which is something I have used before in hand with ReactJS and have experience in.
    They also prefer experience in VS Code which is my preferred application for coding as well as requiring Agile tools such as JIRA and 
    although I Don’t have experience in JIRA itself I have experience in Trello and the Agile process.
    For its development process they use test driven development which is very appealing to me as I have used Jest before for my web related programming.
    Something I would need to improve on and acquire as skills are the use of CI/CD tools such as Jenkins or Bamboo as it is recommended for the job and 
    I would do so by creating a website that I can continuously update as I update the code, 
    this would be a project in my own time that I would use to build up my portfolio.

  <p>
  These tests let me know that I have the personality that works hard and strives to improve myself, It also tells me that I like to experiment with new things to improve myself and change the way I am.

  Although these personality tests may tell me who I am or how I interact with life, I think that everything depends on the scenario and my behaviour would depend on the team and their personalities.

  When forming a team personalities don’t matter too much, as long as they are cooperative as a team and work hard the rest of your personality shouldn’t matter, you can be whatever you want as long as you do your job.
